      <h4><strong><a href="https://www.globalshapers.org/about" target="_blank">Global Shapers Community</a> <a href="https://initiatives.weforum.org/bishkek-hub/overview" target="_blank">Bishkek Hub</strong></h4>
      <p><i>I<a href="https://www.weforum.org/people/ikramidin-zhakypaliev/" target="_blank">joined</a> the Global Shapers Bishkek Hub in 2020, and since then, I have grown into several leadership roles: starting as a Global Shaper, 
        Curator, then Vice-Curator, and as the Impact Officer. A major highlight was leading a team for the MUGALIM project during the pandemic. 
        Our goal was to help teachers all over Kyrgyzstan who were new to online teaching. In just 20 days, my team organized 1,520 applications 
        from teachers and 324 from volunteers. Because we worked quickly, we were able to set up free workshops on tools like Zoom and Google Classroom, 
        helping hundreds of teachers when they needed it most.</i></p>
      <h4><a href="https://www.weforum.org/projects/mugalim-2020/" target="_blank">1. Mugalim project 2020</a></p>
      <p>The Bishkek Hub launched the MUGALIM Project to help teachers in Kyrgyzstan transition from traditional classroom methods to online education,
        a challenge amplified by the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused severe disruptions to learning and is projected to result in an estimated $44 billion 
        economic loss in Central Asia. In partnership with independent education experts and the New School Foundation, the project developed a specialized 
        training program on digital tools, recruited 337 mentors, and successfully trained 1,530 teachers nationwide. Recognizing the critical need to enhance 
        teachersâ€™ digital skills and promote hybrid education, the initiative is now working with the Ministry of Education of Kyrgyzstan to scale the program 
        at the national level. Since then the project has been transformed into successful educational stratup providing AI-assisted teaching tool for educational institutions and 
        professionals across Central Asia. <br /></p>

      <p><strong>17.802: Quantitative Research Methods II:
      Causal Inference</strong></p>
      
      <p>This is the second course in the quantitative research methods sequence at the MIT political science department. Building on the first course (17.800) which covered probability, statistics, and linear regression analysis, this second class provides a survey of more advanced empirical tools, with a particular focus on causal inference. We cover a variety of research designs and statistical methods for causal inference, including experiments, matching, regression, panel methods, difference-in-differences, synthetic control methods, instrumental variable estimation, regression discontinuity designs, causal mediation analysis, nonparametric bounds, and sensitivity analysis. We will analyze the strengths and weaknesses of these methods. Applications are drawn from various fields including political science, public policy, economics, and sociology.</p>

      <p><strong>17.804: Quantitative Research Methods III:
      Generalized Linear Models and Extensions</strong></p>
      
      <p>This course is the third course in the quantitative research methods
sequence at the MIT political science department. Building on the
first two courses of the sequence (17.800 and 17.802), this class
covers advanced statistical tools for empirical analysis in modern
political science. Our focus in this course will be on techniques for
<i> model-based inference</i>, including various regression models for
cross-section data (e.g., binary outcome models, discrete choice
models, sample selection models, event count models, survival outcome
models, etc.) as well as grouped data (e.g., mixed effects models and
hierarchical models). This complements the methods for <i>
design-based inference </i> primarily covered in the previous course of
the sequence. This course also covers basics of the fundamental
statistical principles underlying these models (e.g., maximum
likelihood theory, theory of generalized linear models, Bayesian
statistics) as well as a variety of estimation techniques (e.g.,
numerical optimization, bootstrap, Markov chain Monte Carlo). The
ultimate goal of this course is to provide students with adequate
methodological skills for conducting cutting-edge empirical research
in their own fields of substantive interest.</p>

<p><strong>17.806: Quantitative Research Methods IV: Advanced Topics</strong></p>
      
      <p>This course is the fourth and final course in the quantitative methods sequence at the MIT political science department. The course covers various advanced topics in applied statistics, including those that have only recently been developed in the methodological literature and are yet to be widely applied in political science. The topics for this year are organized into three broad areas: (1) Advanced causal inference, where we build on the basic materials covered earlier in the sequence (17.802) and study more advanced topics; (2) statistical learning, where we provide an overview of machine learning, one of the most active subfields in applied statistics in the past decade; and (3) Bayesian inference and statistical computing, where we extend the model-based inference techniques covered in the previous course of the sequence (17.804) and study more technically sophisticated materials as well as applications in political science.</p> 
      
      <p> I co-taught this course in <strong>Spring 2023</strong>
      with Danny Hidalgo. The syllabus can be downloaded

      <h3>Undergraduate Courses Taught at MIT</h3>
      
      <p><strong>17.803: Political Science Laboratory</strong> (Previously 17.871)</p>
      
      <p>The purpose of this class is to introduce undergraduate political scientists to the basic quantitative tools of political science research. In particular, this class explores the key statistical and computational research tools that social scientists use to frame and answer empirical questions. When students finish this subject successfully, they will be able to conduct quantitative research, be better able to read critically much of the professional literature in political science and other statistically-based fields, and have an employable skill. A particular focus of the class will be on the issue of <i> causal inference</i>. The political world is composed of a web of cause-and-effect relationships that are entangled and intertwined. The complex nature of our world makes our life as political scientists tough and challenging, even compared to those of rocket scientists and nuclear physicists. The central theme that runs throughout the course will be: How can we tell causation from mere association? The answer lies in good <i>research designs</i> and appropriate <i>statistical tools</i>, as students will learn by the end of the semester.</p>
