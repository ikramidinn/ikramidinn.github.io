      <h3>Unsuccessful attempt to teach at <strong><a href="https://www.manas.edu.kg/en" target="_blank">Manas University</strong></a>***</h3>
      <p><strong>***</strong><i>In July 2024, I was awarded the OSCE Academy <a href="https://osce-academy.net/en/alumni/opportunities/jtf/" target="_blank">Junior Teaching Fellowship</a> 
        grant to teach at one of the local universities. I had planned to teach a course on International Political Economy, which was initially approved by the Department of International 
        Relations. The course was listed under ULS-312; however, at the beginning of the Fall semester, it was blocked by the University Rectorate. 
        The reason given was that, since I did not hold a PhD degree, I was not eligible to teach at the university. This experience became one of the key motivations 
        for me to pursue PhD studies.</i></p>
      <h4>ULS-312: International Political Economy, Fall 2024</h4>
      <p><strong>Course Description:</strong></br>
      This course provides an introduction to the field of International Political Economy (IPE). It
examines the interplay between politics and economics on a global scale, exploring how political
institutions, processes, and actors influence economic policies and outcomes, and vice versa. Key
topics include trade, finance, development, and globalization.</br>
      </br>
        <strong>Learning Objectives:</strong></br>
        By the end of this course, students will be able to:</br>
        1. Understand the key concepts and theories in IPE.</br>
        2. Analyze the impact of international political and economic policies.</br>
        3. Evaluate the roles of various international institutions.</br>
        4. Discuss contemporary issues in global trade, finance, and development.</br>
        5. Develop critical thinking and analytical skills in the context of IPE.</br>
