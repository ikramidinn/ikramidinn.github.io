      <h3>Applied research with <a href="https://www.impact-initiatives.org/what-we-do/" target="_blank">IMPACT Inititiatives</a>:</h3>
      
<h4>1. Community-based monitoring of the STREAM Programme project</h4>
      <p>I have supervised the CBM project for the STREAM Programme, aimed to hand over ongoing 
        monitoring capacity to beneficiaries in communities of intervention to improve project accountability, and identify additional areas where support 
        is needed and highlight emergent needs. Thus, the purpose was to set up mutual accountability between communities and 
        programme implementors in the selected communities of Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. <br />

<h4>2. Area-Based Risk Assessment of the Batken and Sughd regions of Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan</h4>
      <p>This research aimed to strengthen Disaster Risk Management in Batken (Kyrgyzstan) and Sughd (Tajikistan) by enhancing local, district, and 
        national stakeholders’ understanding of multi-hazard risks, supporting DRCU in Kyrgyzstan, REACT in Tajikistan, and other partners to better 
        prioritize and plan risk reduction and community preparedness through comprehensive analysis of vulnerabilities, hazard exposure, 
        and critical infrastructure risks.<br />
        Within the assessment, I supervised the quantitative part of the research in Kyrgyzstan: development and design of questionnaire, data collection, 
        cleaning and analysis. Was responsible for the data collection of the Batken district of Batken region, Kyrgyzstan. Conducted Key Informant Interviews, 
        Focus Group Fiscussions (FGD) and Mapping Focus Group Discussions. <br />

<h4>3. Area-Based Risk Assessment of Isfana Watershed in the Fergana Valley</h4>
      <p>The objective was to conduct an in-depth study of climate change impacts and human-induced pressures on the conditions of 
        natural resources, including irrigation water and agricultural, pastoral practices. The research also considered 
        techniques aimed at fostering the resilience of the watershed's community amidst the challenges posed by climate change, 
        disaster risk reduction and cross-cutting issue across considered sectors. <br />
        Within the assessment, I supervised the quantitative part of the research: development and design of questionnaire, data collection, 
        cleaning and analysis.<br />
